# Parser Package

The `parser` package is responsible for parsing SQL queries into a structured format that can be executed by the database engine. It includes a tokenizer, a parser, and an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of the supported SQL commands.

## Import

To use the `parser` package, import it as follows:

```go
import "godb/parser"
```

## Usage

The main entry point for the parser is the `NewParser` function, which takes a SQL query string as input and returns a `Parser` instance. The `Parse` method can then be called to parse the query and return a `Command` object, which represents the parsed query in the AST.

**Example:**

```go
query := "CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name STRING NOT NULL)"
p := parser.NewParser(query)
cmd, err := p.Parse()
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

switch c := cmd.(type) {
case *parser.CreateTableCommand:
    // Execute CreateTableCommand
    fmt.Printf("Table to create: %s\n", c.TableName)
    for _, col := range c.Columns {
        fmt.Printf("  Column: %s %s\n", col.Name, col.Type)
    }
case *parser.InsertCommand:
    // Execute InsertCommand
default:
    // Handle other commands
}
```

## Components

### Tokenizer

The `tokenizer.go` file contains the logic for converting a raw SQL query string into a sequence of tokens. Each token represents a meaningful unit, such as a keyword, an identifier, an operator, or a value.

### Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

The `ast.go` file defines the structure of the parsed SQL commands. It includes the `Command` interface and a set of structs that implement this interface, each representing a specific SQL command (e.g., `CreateTableCommand`, `InsertCommand`, `SelectCommand`).

### Parser

The `parser.go` file contains the `Parser` struct, which is responsible for consuming the tokens generated by the tokenizer and building the corresponding AST. It uses a recursive descent parsing strategy to process the tokens and construct the appropriate `Command` object.

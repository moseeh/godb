# REPL Package

This package provides the entry point for the `godb` Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) command-line interface.

## Usage

This is a main package and is not intended to be imported by other packages. To run the REPL, execute the following command from the root of the project:

```sh
go run cmd/repl/main.go
```

This will start an interactive shell that you can use to interact with the database.
